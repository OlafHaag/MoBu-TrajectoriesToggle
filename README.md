# MotionBuilder: Toggle Trajectories
A MotionBuilder Python script that toggles the visibility of trajectories on selected objects.

## USAGE:
- Activate the Trajectories button in the top of the viewer window.
- Click the small arrow to its right and disable 'Auto Selection'
- This script works best with a keyboard shortcut assigned to it.
It's easiest to do that with Alex Widener's hotkey editor (forked and modified):
