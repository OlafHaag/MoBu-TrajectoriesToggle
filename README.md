# MotionBuilder: Toggle Trajectories
MotionBuilder Python scripts that deal with trajectories. One to toggle the visibility of trajectories on selected objects, another to disable the trajectories on all scence components.

## USAGE:
- Activate the *Trajectories* button in the top of the viewer window.
- Click the small arrow to its right and disable *'Auto Selection'*
- These scripts work best with a keyboard shortcut assigned to each.
It's easiest to do that with the scripts that come with MotionBuilder:
 - In the *Asset Browser* navigate to *Scripts->ComplexTools* and there you'll find the **ActionScriptMgr.py** with which you can assign the scripts found in this repository to some kind of script-slots.
 - You'll also find the **KeyboardMapper.py** tool in which you can first select your configuration (3DS Max, Maya, etc.) and then scroll down to the script entries called *action.global.script1* and so on to assign a keyboard shortcut to the slots you chose before for the scripts.
